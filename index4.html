    <h1>what is the CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language that works alongside HTML to control the visual presentation of web pages. While HTML provides the structure and content of a website, CSS is responsible for its aestheticsâ€”defining the colors, fonts, layouts, and overall look and feel. It allows developers to apply a consistent set of styles across a website, making it easier to manage and update the design. By separating the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), web development becomes more efficient and organized. The "cascading" aspect of CSS refers to its system of prioritizing rules, which allows for powerful and flexible styling by determining which rules take precedence when multiple styles are applied to the same element.
